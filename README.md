# grimdrake
A suite of tools to construct and fill puzzle grids

Grimdrake was originally a "Cryptic Grid Maker" for creating NPL-compliant cryptic grids. It has grown to include a fair amount of grid-filling functionality as well. I'm hoping to make it more usable to others as part of moving it to a public repository.
